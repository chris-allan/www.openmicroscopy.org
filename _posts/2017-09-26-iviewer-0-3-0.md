title: Release of OMERO.iviewer 0.3.0
intro-blurb: The OME team is pleased to announce the release of OMERO.iviewer 0.3.0
---
Today we are releasing our version 0.3.0 of OMERO.iviewer: an OMERO.web app
for visualizing images in OMERO. This version requires OMERO 5.3.3 or newer.

This 0.3.0 version is still work-in-progress and some areas are likely to be
modified.

This version includes:

- support for saving the image in the viewport as a .png file
- support for exporting basic ROIs measurement (area and length) in a CSV file
- support for opening datasets and wells
- support for saving the projected image as a new image in OMERO
- improved support for ROI transformations
- upgraded Openlayers and Aurelia
- addition of ROI count

For installation instructions go to
[omero-iviewer on PyPI](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/omero-iviewer/).
