Dear All,

Today we are releasing OMERO 5.2.5. This is a security release to fix
the OMERO.shares API which was bypassing intended security
restrictions and granting elevated privileges to read
otherwise-restricted data.

Full details of the issue are available on
https://www.openmicroscopy.org/site/products/omero/secvuln/2016-SV2-share

This release **does not** upgrade the version of Bio-Formats which
OMERO uses.

The software is available at:
http://downloads.openmicroscopy.org/omero/5.2.5

Upgrade information is at

Regards,

The OME Team
