intro-blurb: The OME team is pleased to announce the release of OMERO 5.2.0
---
Today we are releasing OMERO 5.2.0, a full production-ready release of our new major development line for OMERO. With this release, the 5.1 line enters maintenance mode and will only be updated for security issues. This release drops support for Java 1.6; features major upgrading of OMERO.web and re-working of the Java Gateway; and introduces new user features and many fixes and performance improvements:

* improved support for many file formats via Bio-Formats 5.1.5
* faster import for images with a large number of ROIs
* performance improvements for OMERO.web including faster data tree loading
* Java Web Start has been dropped, it is no longer possible to launch the desktop clients from the web
* reworked display of metadata and annotations in both OMERO.web and OMERO.insight
* many bugs fixed

Developer and system administrator updates include:

* the OMERO web framework no longer bundles a copy of the Django package, this dependency must be installed manually
* updated jstree to 3.08 and now using json for all tree loading to substantially improve performance
* removed FastCGI support, OMERO.web can be deployed using WSGI
* configuration property :property:`omero.graphs.wrap` which allowed switching back to the old server code for moving and deleting data has now been removed. You should migrate to using the new graph request operations before 5.3 when the old request operations will be removed
* introduced new Java Gateway to facilitate the development of Java applications
* aligned OMERO Rect with OME-XML schema for ROI. Clients using the OMERO.blitz server API to work with ROIs will need to be updated
