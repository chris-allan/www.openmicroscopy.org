title: Release of OMERO.mtools 1.3.1
intro-blurb: The OME team is pleased to announce the latest OMERO.mtools bug-fix release
---
Today we are releasing a new version of OMERO.mtools, a suite of MATLAB-based
tools for performing common image analysis tasks on images stored in OMERO.

Version 1.3.1 fixes a bug preventing users from accessing the auto-draw
feature in BoxIt and is compatible with OMERO 5.3.x only.

The software is available at [archived downloads](https://downloads.openmicroscopy.org/mtools/1.3.1/).

Any problems or comments, please use the [OME Forums or mailing lists]({{ site.baseurl }}/support/).
