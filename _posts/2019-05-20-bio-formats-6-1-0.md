title: Release of Bio-Formats 6.1.0
intro-blurb: The OME team is pleased to announce the release of Bio-Formats 6.1.0
---

This latest release contains the completion of Phase I of OME’s work on improved support for binary vessels. In addition to the KLB format we supported in version 6.0, we have now added a reader for the BigDataViewer format developed at MPI-CBG Dresden. We hope this work is useful for the light sheet microscopy community.
 
We’ve also worked to improve the integration of Bio-Formats 6.1 into OMERO 5.5 (to be released Summer 2019). Finally, we’ve also reviewed and updated many of Bio-Formats dependencies to align them with the Fiji ecosystem.  This includes an update of the component netcdf library used by Bio-Formats, which should improve the experience of users working with some of the HDF5-based file formats.

 
File format fixes and improvements:

* BDV
  * added a new reader for Big Data Viewer files

File format fixes and improvements:

* Applied Precision CellWorX
  * improved handling of thumbnail files
* DeltaVision
  * updated handling of `rcpnl` files to treat each file as a single timepoint
* FakeReader
  * removed `header` key from original metadata
* Hamamatsu VMS
  * removed `header` key from original metadata
* Hitachi S-4800
  * removed `header` key from original metadata
* ICS (Image Cytometry Standard)
  * fixed an issue reading .ics/.ids files written by SVI Huygens (thanks to Jan Eglinger)
* Imaris IMS
  * fixed issues with newer files which had been failing due to older `netcdf` version
* JPEG
  * improved the reading of EXIF data
* Lambert Instruments FLIM
  * added support for packed UINT12 datatype (thanks to Johan Herz)
* LEO
  * fixed a bug with the parsing of physical sizes
  * improved support for additional global metadata fields
* Olympus OIR
  * fixed a bug which would show empty pixels when more than 1000 timepoints

Automated test changes:

* added additional tests for HCS/SPW datasets to ensure Plate, PlateAcquisition, Well, WellSample, and WellSample position values are configured where present
* added a new `file-leak-detector` test to flag potential memory leaks

Bio-Formats API changes:

* ImageConverter as used in `bfconvert` command line tool is now public
* made ImageReader more defensive against exceptions thrown when determining reader type
* fixed an issue when performing a non-sequential write for multi-resolution TIFF files

Component changes:

* ome-common was upgraded to 6.0.3
* perf4j was upgraded to 0.9.16
* removed Guava dependency which will be pulled transitively from the 
  upstream ome-common dependency
* jhdf5 was upgraded to 14.12.6
* metadata-extractor was upgraded to 2.11.0
* xercesImpl version 2.8.1 was added as it is no longer a dependency of metadata-extractor
* netcdf` was upgraded to 4.6.13

and will shortly be available from the Java-8 update site for Fiji users.
