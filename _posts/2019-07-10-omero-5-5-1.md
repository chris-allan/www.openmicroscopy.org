intro-blurb: The OME team is pleased to announce the release of OMERO 5.5.1.
---
Today we are releasing OMERO 5.5.1, a full production-ready release of OMERO.

This bug fix release focuses on installation issues that were seen with 5.5.0
and also upgrades the version of Bio-Formats which OMERO uses to [6.1.0](https://docs.openmicroscopy.org/bio-formats/6.1.1/about/whats-new.html).

This version **does not** require a database upgrade.


* OMERO.web:
  * Allow the customization of the web logo
  * Allow overriding server configuration
  * Dynamically look up client download links
  * Fix description in new Project, Dataset etc.
  * Fix layout of the user account form
* Java gateway:
  * New methods added to allow change group of objects
  * New methods added to load objects (datasets, etc.) by name
  * New methods added to get original and repository paths of images
  * Minor fixes in createDataset and getPixelSize methods
* Import:
  * Add import target support for creating Projects
* Scripts:
  * Enable annotating Projects and Datasets with the Populate Metadata script
* OMERO.server:
  * Fix SSL cipher issue to allow Insight to be used from Fedora 30
  * Fix issue with loading Hibernateâ€™s DTD when offline
  * Properly close OMERO.tables which kept sessions alive

**Note**: Due to the stricter closing of OMERO.tables, it may be necessary to update plugins like omero-metadata which previously were leaking files.

The software is available at [archived downloads](https://downloads.openmicroscopy.org/omero/5.5.1). Clients are no longer available from that location since they will be released more frequently than the server.

OMERO.insight is now available at [release v5.5.3](https://github.com/ome/omero-insight/releases/tag/v5.5.3).

* Fix SSL cipher issue to allow Insight to be used from Fedora 30
* Fix stack overflow exception
* Bump to omero-gateway-java 5.5.3
