title: Release of Bio-Formats 5.6.0
intro-blurb: The OME team is pleased to announce the release of Bio-Formats 5.6.0
---
Today we are releasing Bio-Formats 5.6.0 which includes the following changes:

File format fixes and improvements:

* Zeiss CZI
    * added support for images from Elyra PALM system
    * prevented a potential infinite loop when a scene with a pyramid is
      missing

* cellSens VSI
    * a new option has been added to throw an exception rather than logging a
      warning if .ets file is missing. The option, 
      cellsens.fail_on_missing_ets, can be used via the MetadataOptions API, as a parameter in the command line tools or via the Bio-Formats configuration dialog in ImageJ

*  MetaMorph Stack (STK)
    * fixed an error with HCS style datasets always returning the first plane
      regardless of the requested index
    * updated to use stage labels starting with Scan to detect when a whole plate is saved in a single .stk file
    * fixed a bug for ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException when an image contains a
      single Z plane

* Gatan Digital Micrograph
    * added support for Z stacks and ROIs
    * fixed several bugs in tag parsing

* PerkinElmer Operetta
    * ensure TIFF files exist before reading

* JPEG
    * support added for images with more than Integer.MAX_VALUE pixels

Bug fixes and improvements:

* JPEGTileDecoder
    * class now implements AutoCloseable to prevent resource leaks

* Bio-Formats Plugin
    * improved performance when using options to concatenate multiple series together

* TiffSaver
    * made performance improvements to prevent the writing of a new IFD for each tile, resulting in significant file size reductions for images with a large quantity of tiles

Documentation improvements:

* updated website and URL links for new OME website
* added missing Andor SIF to supported formats page
* added a new page Working with whole slide images outlining the API support for pyramids/resolutions
* fixed broken documentation links for external resources which are no longer available
* updated the style of Sphinx documentation

Component architecture changes/decoupling:

* decoupled image encoding and decoding routines to the new
  [ome/ome-codecs GitHub repository](https://github.com/ome/ome-codecs) and
  consumed as 'org.openmicroscopy:ome-codecs' artifact
  from Maven Central
* removed components/forks/jai - decoupled to the new
  [ome/ome-jai GitHub repository](https://github.com/ome/ome-jai) and consumed
  as part of 'org.openmicroscopy:ome-jai' artifact from Maven Central
* replaced components/formats-api/codecs classes with wrappers around
  'org.openmicroscopy:ome-codecs'
* replaced components/formats-bsd/codecs classes with wrappers around
  'org.openmicroscopy:ome-codecs'

Updated build system:

* Ant now removes the build files of the bundles during 'clean' to prevent a mix of dependencies

Full details can be found at [Bio-Formats version history](https://docs.openmicroscopy.org/bio-formats/5.6.0/about/whats-new.html).

The software is available at [archived downloads](https://downloads.openmicroscopy.org/bio-formats/5.6.0) and will shortly be available from the Java-8 update site for Fiji users.
