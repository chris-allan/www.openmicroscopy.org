title:  Release of OMERO & Bio-Formats 5.0.8
intro-blurb: Today we are launching 5.0.8, a bug-fixing release for OMERO.
---

This release fixes one specific issue causing OMERO.insight to crash when trying to open the Projection tab for an image with multiple z-stacks.

The software is available from OMERO Downloads - [downloads.openmicroscopy.org/omero/5.0.8/](http://downloads.openmicroscopy.org/omero/5.0.8/)

For information on upgrading your server, see the upgrade guide for
system administrators - [server upgrade page](http://www.openmicroscopy.org/site/support/omero5/sysadmins/server-upgrade.html)

Bio-Formats 5.0.8 is also being released today to keep the version numbers in sync. However, there are no changes to the code.

Kind regards, The OME team
