We are pleased to announce the release of OMERO.figure 3.1.2.

Bug fixes and improvements include:

* fixed the display of the channel buttons in IE11
* added the IDR figure to the [demo](http://figure.openmicroscopy.org/demo/)
* removed extra computation when converting radians and degrees (thanks to
  [CarnÃ« Draug](https://github.com/carandraug))

Also note that the README for the
[OMERO.gallery web app](https://github.com/ome/omero-gallery) has been updated
to point at the new documentation URL.

Any problems or comments, please use the [OME Forums or mailing lists]({{ site.baseurl }}/support/).
