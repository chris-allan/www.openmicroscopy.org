---

Today we are releasing Bio-Formats 6.2.1 which included the following changes:

File format fixes and improvements:

* Applied Precision CellWorX
  * corrected plane positions for series index > 0 rather than reusing positions from the first series
* DeltaVision
  * added objective info for new Applied Precision 100X/1.4 lensID
  * updated so that date from dv file will override log file date to avoid locale dependent dates
* Leica LAS AF LIF (Leica Image File Format)
  * fixed units and indexing for tile-based plane positions
* TIFF
  * fixed a potential exception in MinimalTiffReader when the TIFF is stored using very 
     large tile/strips dimensions
* Zeiss CZI
  * fixed a bug to prevent an index out of bounds exception when populating positions

Bug fixes and improvements:

* ``bfconvert`` has been updated so that when the dimensions of a sub-resolution are smaller than the 
  requested tile size then default to the size of the sub resolution
* fixed a bug in the execution of ``bfsave`` in the GNU Octave environment

Codec updates:

* ``ome-codecs`` was upgraded to 0.2.5
* JPEG codec updated to reduce decompression time for 8-bit RGB images
* Huffman codec updated to allow the decoding tree to go all the way down to the 16-bit depth required 
  by the standard (thanks to Aaron Avery)
* Lossless JPEG codec updated to provide better compliance with the LJPEG standard (thanks to Aaron Avery)

Documentation improvements:

* added instructions for building Bio-Formats with IntelliJ IDEA
* corrected command line tools documentation for the novalid and noncore options
* updated broken links to Barre's Medical Imaging Samples
