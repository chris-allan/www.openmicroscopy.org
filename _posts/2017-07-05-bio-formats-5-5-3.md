---
Today we are releasing Bio-Formats 5.5.3 which includes the following changes:

* Zeiss CZI
    * fix to store Bézier ROIs as polygons, using the control points for the set of Bézier curves to form an approximation of the ROI
    * improved parsing of stage positions in metadata
    * improved parsing of detector gain values
    * removed OME-XML validation errors by fixing potential for duplicate detector IDs
    * removed invalid XML failures for Modulo label elements
    * time increment metadata now populated on ``Pixels`` element
    * fix to deal with consecutive empty planes in a series (thanks to Nicholas Trahearn)
* DICOM
    * no longer allow core metadata to be modified when determining if files belong to a DICOM dataset
* Nikon NIS-Elements ND2
    * fixed calculation for scanline padding
* Kodak BIP
    * stricter file type checking enforced by no longer relying only on the file suffix
* MINC MRI
    * improved parsing of metadata by correcting units for physical sizes, pixel type and capturing XYZ plane positions in OME-XML
* Bio-Rad Gel
    * fixed the width of pixel data offset field
* DeltaVision
    * improved accuracy of format detection checking for input streams
* Andor SIF
    * fixed support for cropped images by parsing bounding box of the stored image

Documentation improvements:

* Olympus cellSens VSI updated to include list of available specifications
