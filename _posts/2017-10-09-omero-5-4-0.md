---
Today we are releasing OMERO 5.4.0, a full production-ready release of OMERO;
featuring a new configurable user role "Restricted Administrators"; further
improvements to OMERO.web; additions to OMERO.cli; and many fixes and
performance improvements:

-  added [Administrators with restricted privileges](https://docs.openmicroscopy.org/omero/5.4.0/sysadmins/admins-with-restricted-privileges.html) to allow sysadmins to delegate
   management tasks to facility managers without granting them full system
   admin privileges, or to allow trusted users such as image analysts to carry
   out tasks on behalf of all other users
-  fixed color conversion to RGBA
-  added support for exporting images in a plate as OME-TIFF
-  improved creation of rendering settings for image without any stats e.g.
   32bit images
-  improved performance for moving large Plates
-  fixed import bug in OMERO.insight
-  fixed projection of images if the range of timepoints specified is not the
   full range
-  added support for transfering ownership of all the data of a given user
   using CLI
-  renamed "Reverse Intensity" command to "Invert" in image viewers
-  added support for ImageColumn with Screen and Plate targets in the
   populate_metadata script
-  OMERO.web UI fixes:
   * improved display of Plates and Wells
   * fixed label position for Wells
   * added the ability to display Image and Well metadata in the Tables 
     section for the same Plate
   * improved copy/paste of rendering settings workflow
   * improved layout in left-hand panel
   * fixed filtering issue
   * added support for administrators with restricted privileges to create
     Project/Dataset for other users
   * rolled back the display of tables in the viewer

Sysadmin changes include:

-  added support for the creation of administrators with restricted privileges
   in OMERO.web admin panel
-  added method to create administrators with restricted privileges specifying
   a password
-  added specific installation instructions for Debian 9
-  added configuration to limit queries that public users can do in OMERO.web
-  created minimal NGINX configuration file that can be included in a fixed
   file to allow custom NGINX options to be defined only once (e.g. SSL
   options)
-  installed django-redis by default
-  CLI improvements and fixes:
   * fixed admin plugin so ``cleanse`` can handle larger directories
   * added to chown plugin ability to target all of given users' data
   * adjusted handling of standard input 
   * added infrastructure to load external CLI plugins
   * dropped support for command ``admin ports``

Developer updates include:

-  added method to JavaGateway to manipulate admin privileges
-  fixed issue with JSONP decorator
-  removed SciPy dependency
-  adjusted OMERO.blitz API to allow some query results to be cached

   call

-  removed unused 3rd party libraries in OMERO.web
-  added support for PyTables version 3.4+
-  deprecated Path Object in OMERO model
-  updated the documentation for server installation on Mac OS to no longer
   use the homebrew formulae from https://github.com/ome/homebrew-alt (these
   are not working and will not be fixed)

Further changes to the Python BlitzGateway are described in [What's new for OMERO 5.4.0 for developers](https://docs.openmicroscopy.org/omero/5.4.0/developers/whatsnew.html).

This release also upgrades the version of Bio-Formats which OMERO uses to [5.7.1](https://docs.openmicroscopy.org/bio-formats/5.7.1/about/whats-new.html).

Upgrade information is on the [server upgrade page](https://docs.openmicroscopy.org/omero/5.4.0/sysadmins/server-upgrade.html). 
Sysadmins who used the workaround for the [latest security advisory]({{ site.baseurl }}/security/advisories/2017-SV4-guest-user) rather than
upgrading to 5.3.5 will also find instructions for reversing it should they
wish to, as this release also includes the fix.

The software is available at [archived downloads](https://downloads.openmicroscopy.org/omero/5.4.0).

Any problems or comments, please use the [OME Forums or mailing lists]({{ site.baseurl }}/support/).
