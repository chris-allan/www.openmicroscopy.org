Dear All,

Today we are releasing OMERO 5.2.4. This is a security release to fix
the cleanse.py script used by the "bin/omero admin cleanse" command,
which was not properly respecting user permissions and may lead to
data loss.

Full details of the issue are available on
https://www.openmicroscopy.org/site/products/omero/secvuln/2016-SV1-cleanse

The script and command have now been made admin-only. It is highly
suggested that you upgrade your server or apply the patch available
from the security page.

This release **does not** upgrade the version of Bio-Formats which
OMERO uses, or feature any other updates.

The software is available at:
http://downloads.openmicroscopy.org/omero/5.2.4

Upgrade information is at

Regards,

The OME Team
