---

Today we are releasing Bio-Formats 6.4.0 which includes the following changes:

File format fixes and improvements:

* Applied Precision CellWorX
  * added support for multiple Z sections
* DeltaVision
  * added and updated objective metadata based on values from softWoRx 7.2.0 (thanks to David Pinto)
* Hamamatsu NDPI
  * added support for JPEG-XR compression
  * added full support for files larger than 4 GB
  * improved support for a number of additional metadata tags
* InCell
  * inverted Y coordinate in plane/field positions to correct stitching of tiles
* PerkinElmer Vectra QPTIFF
  * plane position values will now be populated on OME-XML
* TIFF
  * values for XPosition and YPosition in original metadata will now be more accurately stored as doubles
  * implemented a fix to prevent integer overflow when reading from a large tile greater than 2 GB
* Ventana BIF
  * improved handling of physical sizes for pre-stitched TIFFs
* Zeiss CZI
  * added a fix for uncompressed pixels incorrectly flagged as JPEG-XR
  * fixed a bug so that line-scans are now read correctly (thanks to Stephan Wagner-Conrad)
  * improved parsing of detector metadata

Bio-Formats tools improvements:

* added a new ``nobigtiff`` option to ``bfconvert`` to disable automatic switching to BigTiff based upon the 
  number of pixel bytes (TIFF files larger than 4GB). This may be useful when converting using a compression 
  codec so that the output file size is less than 4GB
* fixed a bug in ``xmlvalid`` tool to properly handle lowercasing of file names
* added new bfGetPlaneAtZCT function to MATLAB toolbox to retrieve a particular plane at a ZCT coordinate 
  (thanks to Mark Kittisopikul)
* added a new bfTestInRange helper function to MATLAB toolbox with improved performance and error handling 
  (thanks to Mark Kittisopikul)
* fixed a bug when using ``bfconvert`` on multi series files with only a single timepoint, channel or Z slice selected

Bio-Formats API updates:

* version of ``jxrlib`` has been updated to 0.2.2
* version of ``ome-codecs`` has been updated to 0.3.0 which includes performance upgrades for 
  LZW compression (thanks to Alexander Popiel)
* moved JPEG-XR codec and service from ``formats-gpl`` to ``formats-bsd`` component
* TiffParser and TiffSaver have now been updated to implement Closeable
* added a documentation note to use one IFD instance per plane with ``saveBytes`` in ``TiffWriter``
* FormatWriter will now create output file's parent directory if needed
* FakeReader now allows for DeltaT to be set in INI file
* FakeReader now handles INI files in plates created by ``mkfake``
* fixed a number of deprecation warnings in various readers
