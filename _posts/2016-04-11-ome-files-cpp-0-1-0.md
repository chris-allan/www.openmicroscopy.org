title: Release of OME Files C++ 0.1.0
intro-blurb: The OME team is pleased to announce the release of OME Files C++ 0.1.0
---
OME Files is a reference implementation of the OME Data Model and
OME-TIFF file format for the storage and interchange of biological
imaging data and metadata. It provides support for:

- The OME Data Model (model objects, metadatastore, XSL transforms and XML validation)
- OME-TIFF reader
- OME-TIFF writer

Major changes in this release include:

- Support for transparent model upgrades and downgrades when reading an OME-TIFF
- Splitting of the codebase into a separate repository for each component

OME Files C++ was previously named "Bio-Formats C++" and was part of
the Bio-Formats Java source repository. With this initial release of
OME Files, the C++ source code has been moved from the Java source
repository into a set of C++ source repositories, which can be
released independently of the Java implementation. The Common, Files
and QtWidgets components were split out into separate repositories,
using "git filter-branch" to retain the history. The XML component
continues to reside in bioformats.git for the moment, but will also be
split out in a future release. The components may be built
individually, or as a collection using the OME Super-Build. This
release is a first step in our
[strategy](http://blog.openmicroscopy.org/file-formats/data-model/future-plans/2016/01/26/bf-model-status/)
to build a native reference implementation for the OME Data Model,
OME-TIFF, and hopefully more modern formats like HDF5, etc.

**Downloads**

The software release is available at [archived downloads](http://downloads.openmicroscopy.org/ome-files-cpp/0.1.0/). This
page includes links to the individual repositories and source
releases, as well as the documentation and binary builds of the
collection for several common platforms, including Windows, Linux and
MacOS X.

**Future changes**

The planned changes over the next few weeks include:

*OME XML*

- 2015-01 model support (includes unit conversion support)

*OME Files*

- documentation rework, including updates for the new CMake options for building and the supported versions of all components
- porting of recent Java fixes to the OME-TIFF reader and writer

*Super-Build*

- VS2015 support
