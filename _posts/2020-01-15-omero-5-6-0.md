title: Release of OMERO 5.6.0 with Python 3
intro-blurb: The OME team is pleased to announce the release of OMERO 5.6.0
---

Today we are very excited (also proud, delighted and relieved) to announce the
release of OMERO 5.6.0, the first Python3-based release of the OMERO server and
web components. This release of OMERO also upgrades the version of Bio-Formats
to
[6.3.1](https://docs.openmicroscopy.org/bio-formats/6.3.1/about/whats-new.html).

All Python code can and must now be installed separately from the
OMERO.server.zip, meaning that fixes can be released more quickly. This version
**does not** require a database upgrade but **only** supports Python 3. We
strongly encourage an immediate upgrade since maintenance of Python 2.7 ended
[promptly](https://pythonclock.org/) on New Year’s Day and **all future OMERO
security patches** will only be available for OMERO 5.6 and greater.

### Deployment environments:

The current list of [supported
platforms](https://docs.openmicroscopy.org/omero/5.6.0/sysadmins/version-requirements.html?highlight=version%20requirements#operating-system-support)
is:

* CentOS 7
* Ubuntu 18.04
* Debian 10*

\* Note that Ice 3.6 is the only version of Ice that we support. On Debian 10,
the default is Ice 3.7 requiring extra installation steps. There are no plans
to add support for Ice 3.7.

Additionally, we have [installation
guides](https://docs.openmicroscopy.org/omero/5.6.0/sysadmins/unix/server-installation.html)
for Debian 9 and Ubuntu 16.04. In both cases, Python 3.5 will be installed. Not
    all functionality has been tested with Python 3.5 but we do not expect
    major issues. If you choose to install OMERO on these environments, we’d
    welcome feedback and comments.

For all other platforms, we recommend using conda. An [ome channel](http://anaconda.org/ome) is available on anaconda.org while we investigate moving to [conda-forge](https://conda-forge.org/).

### Getting Started:

Documentation for this release is available under
<https://docs.openmicroscopy.org/omero/5.6.0/> with the [Python 3
Migration](https://docs.openmicroscopy.org/omero/5.6.0/sysadmins/python3-migration.html)
page being a good place for developers and system administrators to start.

OMERO.server.zip is available at
[https//downloads.openmicroscopy.org/omero/5.6.0/](https://downloads.openmicroscopy.org/omero/5.6.0/).
The OMERO.py.zip has been dropped in favor of PyPI.

Clients are available on GitHub. The updated OMERO.insight 5.5.8 is available
at <https://github.com/ome/omero-insight/releases/tag/v5.5.8>, which supports
connections to both 5.5 and 5.6 servers.

Official Docker images are available as usual on Docker Hub with either the latest or the 5.6 tag:

* <https://hub.docker.com/r/openmicroscopy/omero-web-standalone>
* <https://hub.docker.com/r/openmicroscopy/omero-server>
