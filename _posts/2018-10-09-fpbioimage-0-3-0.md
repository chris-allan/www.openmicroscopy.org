We are pleased to announce the release of OMERO.FPBioimage 0.3.0

This OMERO.web app allows to view images in OMERO using
[FPBioimage](http://fpb.ceb.cam.ac.uk/), a volumetric visualization tool.
This version updates to Version 4 of FPBioimage allowing for batch loading of image planes in an "atlas".

The application is available from PyPI.
For installation instructions go to [omero-fpbioimage](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/omero-fpbioimage).

Any problems or comments, please use the [OME Forums or mailing lists]({{ site.baseurl }}/support/).
