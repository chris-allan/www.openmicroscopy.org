intro-blurb: The OME team is pleased to announce the release of OMERO 5.3.1
---
Today we are releasing OMERO 5.3.1. This is a bug-fix release focusing on shares.

Improvements include:

* allow to view images in share. LUT, despite being available in the UI, are not supported in share, this is a known limitation that could lead to the image displayed as thumbnail and the image displayed in the main viewer not being synchronized.
* allow to import hidden image files (Windows client issue)
* clarify installation of OMERO.web
* save polygon and polyline as defined in the OME model
* fix viewing of images without pixels size
* add support for large image export as jpeg/png from OMERO.insight

This release also upgrades the version of Bio-Formats which OMERO uses to
[5.4.1](https://docs.openmicroscopy.org/bio-formats/5.4.1/about/whats-new.html).

The software is available at [archived downloads](https://downloads.openmicroscopy.org/omero/5.3.1).
