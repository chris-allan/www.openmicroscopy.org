---
Today we are releasing Bio-Formats 5.4.1 which includes the following changes:

File format improvements:

* MIAS (Maia Scientific)
    * added a fix for a possible exception when image files are not found under channel-specific subdirectories
* BD Pathway
    * added fix to check if Experiment.exp is a directory or an experiment file
* Imspector OBF
    * enabled forward compatibility for future versions as the OBF format is backwards compatible (thanks to Bjoern Thiel)

Documentation improvements:

* updated external homepage link for FocalPoint
* removed Imago from list of visualization and analysis applications as it is no longer available from the Mayachitra website
* added links to public sample files for Hamamatsu NDPI and Hamamatsu VMS (see [images](http://downloads.openmicroscopy.org/images/))
* listed OpenSlide as available software for supported formats
* added a new developer page detailing in-memory reading and writing (see [Bio-Formats version history](https://docs.openmicroscopy.org/bio-formats/5.4.1/about/whats-new.html))
* updated the Bio-Formats API versioning policy which now follows strict semantic versioning (see [versioning policy](https://docs.openmicroscopy.org/bio-formats/5.4.1/about/index.html#versioning-policy))
* a new options page has been added detailing the usage of configurable format specific options for readers and writers (see [options](https://docs.openmicroscopy.org/bio-formats/5.4.1/formats/options.html)). Links to the available options are also included under the relevant supported formats.

Full details can be found at [Bio-Formats version history](https://docs.openmicroscopy.org/bio-formats/5.4.1/about/whats-new.html).

The software is available at [archived downloads](http://downloads.openmicroscopy.org/bio-formats/5.4.1)and will shortly be available from the Java-8 update site for Fiji users.
