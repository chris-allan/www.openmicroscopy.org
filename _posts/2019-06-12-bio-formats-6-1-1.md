Today we are releasing Bio-Formats 6.1.1 which included the following changes:

 
File format fixes and improvements:

* DeltaVision
  * added new lens definitions associated with `rcpnl` files
* Gatan Digital Micrograph (DM3/DM4)
  * now parsing the `Montage` tag to determine if tiles are present
* Leica LAS AF LIF (Leica Image File Format)
  * added fix to correctly read scale from polygon regions of interest (thanks to Sean Warren)
* PerkinElmer Columbus 
  * improved handling of truncated TIFF files to return blank planes
* PerkinElmer Opera Flex
  * plate barcodes are now used to improve grouping and handling of truncated files
* TIFF (Tagged Image File Format)
  * improved parsing times for images stored as uncompressed contiguous strips
* Zeiss CZI
  * improved plane position metadata for many CZI datasets

Automated test changes:

* format reader tests have been updated to handle PerkinElmer Columbus 
  datasets with flex files

Documentation improvements:

* added help for missing options in ``bfconvert`` command line tool

Full details can be found at [Bio-Formats version history](https://docs.openmicroscopy.org/bio-formats/6.1.1/about/whats-new.html).

The software is available at [archived downloads](https://downloads.openmicroscopy.org/bio-formats/6.1.1)
and will shortly be available from the Java-8 update site for Fiji users.

The following are issues which are being considered for the next minor release 6.2.0:
* inclusion of a new reader for [Mikroscan TIFF](https://github.com/openmicroscopy/bioformats/pull/3333)
* inclusion of a new reader for [Ventana .bif files](https://github.com/openmicroscopy/bioformats/pull/3336)
* fix for NDPI files with empty marker tag. This was originally aimed for a patch release with the fix https://github.com/openmicroscopy/bioformats/pull/3248 but after further investigation it will require a larger fix to our JPEG Turbo Service which will mean it is suitable for a minor release.
