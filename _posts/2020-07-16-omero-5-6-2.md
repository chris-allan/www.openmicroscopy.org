title: Release of OMERO.server 5.6.2 and OMERO.web 5.7.0
intro-blurb: This release includes OMERO.server 5.6.2, OMERO.web 5.7.0, OMERO.py 5.7.1 and OMERO.iviewer 0.10.0
---

Today we are releasing OMERO.server 5.6.2 which fixes installation instructions for CentOS 7, 
adds installation instructions for both OMERO.web and OMERO.server on CentOS 8 and Ubuntu 20.04,
and finally drops support for Ubuntu 16.04 and removes the corresponding installation instructions.
We are also releasing OMERO.web 5.7.0 and OMERO.py 5.7.1 which both contain some API additions.

OMERO.server 5.6.2 runs in the same deployment environments as OMERO.server 5.6.0 and
the Bio-Formats Memoizer cache will be invalidated.

### Installing the Software:

For full details of the changes with the OMERO 5.6 series see the
[OMERO 5.6.0]({{ site.baseurl }}/2020/01/15/omero-5-6-0.html) release
announcement. Full documentation for this release is available
under <https://docs.openmicroscopy.org/omero/5.6.2/>

OMERO.server 5.6.2 is available from
[archived downloads](https://downloads.openmicroscopy.org/omero/5.6.2/artifacts/).
[OMERO.web 5.7.0](https://pypi.org/project/omero-web/5.7.0/) and [OMERO.iviewer 0.10.0](https://pypi.org/project/omero-iviewer/0.10.0/) are both available from PyPI.
These have been tested with
[OMERO.py 5.7.1](https://pypi.org/project/omero-py/5.7.1/) so we
recommend that you upgrade OMERO.py on both server and web deployments.

Official Docker images are available as usual on Docker Hub with either
the latest or the 5.6 tag:

* <https://hub.docker.com/r/openmicroscopy/omero-web-standalone>
* <https://hub.docker.com/r/openmicroscopy/omero-server>

You are invited to discuss this announcement on
[the image.sc forum](https://forum.image.sc/tags/c/data-management/29/omero).

All the best with your upgrades,

The OME Team
