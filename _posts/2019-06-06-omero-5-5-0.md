title: Release of OMERO 5.5.0
intro-blurb: The OME team is pleased to announce the release of OMERO 5.5.0.
---
Today we are releasing OMERO 5.5.0, a full production-ready release of OMERO.

This release also upgrades the version of Bio-Formats which OMERO uses to [6.1.0](https://docs.openmicroscopy.org/bio-formats/6.1.0/about/whats-new.html).

This version **does not** require a database upgrade.

For more information about the aim of the 5.5 series and future plan, please read our [blog post](http://blog.openmicroscopy.org/)


Sysadmin and developers improvements include:

This release focuses on dropping support for Java 7, Python 2.6 and Ice 3.5,
adding support for Java 11 and PostgreSQL 10, and on decoupling the Java components to new,
separate repositories, each with a new [Gradle](https://gradle.org) build system:

- https://github.com/ome/omero-dsl-plugin
- https://github.com/ome/omero-model
- https://github.com/ome/omero-common
- https://github.com/ome/omero-romio
- https://github.com/ome/omero-renderer
- https://github.com/ome/omero-server
- https://github.com/ome/omero-blitz
- https://github.com/ome/omero-gateway-java
- https://github.com/ome/omero-blitz-plugin
- https://github.com/ome/omero-insight
- https://github.com/ome/omero-matlab
- https://github.com/ome/omero-javapackager-plugin
- https://github.com/ome/omero-api-plugin

This has the goal of enabling more fine-grained releases.
A new restriction is that the names of server configuration properties
may include only letters, numbers and the symbols ".", "_", "-".

New plugins like omero-artifact-plugin allow reducing the boilerplate
code in the build scripts of the decoupled repositories.
Though initially disruptive, we hope this modernization and modularization will ease participation in the development of OMERO.

  - Remove the generation of Ivy dependencies.html files

Additionally, this release improves the Web interface when OMERO is opened to the public
and contains some useful CLI improvements.

  - Introduce Advanced Search to allow and/or search options
  - Fix description in new Project, Dataset etc.

  - Disable refresh button while existing refresh in progress
  - Improve public user support

- cli:

  - Clearly indicate empty log files when running a diagnostic
  - Fix bug when running `config load` passing a directory instead of a file
  - Add option to delete keys from map annotations


The software is available at [archived downloads](https://downloads.openmicroscopy.org/omero/5.5.0). Clients are no longer available from that location.

OMERO.insight is now available at [release v5.5.0](https://github.com/ome/omero-insight/releases/tag/v5.5.0). The installation process has been improved. Users can now install to their local user folder on Windows and it comes bundled with a Java runtime so those without Administators rights can use the application. It is still possible for those with Java installed to launch the application using a ``.bat`` file.

OMERO.matlab is now available at [release v5.5.0](https://github.com/ome/omero-matlab/releases/tag/v5.5.0)
