title: Release of OMERO 5.3.2
intro-blurb: The OME team is pleased to announce the latest OMERO bug-fix release
---
Today we are releasing OMERO 5.3.2, a bug-fix release. Improvements include:

-  improved populate_metadata plugin
-  fixed deletion of a range of objects from CLI
-  textual annotations without a namespace can now be added at import using the CLI
-  improved thumbnails retrieval in OMERO.web
-  added "Open With" option to the right-hand panel in OMERO.web
-  private group owners are now not offered the ability to annotate other people's data in OMERO.web, an action which was not permitted by the server anyway
-  preview of wells now available in the right-hand panel

Sysadmin changes include:

-  made the Django middleware classes configurable using a new property
-  added property to allow connections from specified origins (CORS)
-  administrators can now use the CLI to move data between groups without belonging to those groups

Note that for OMERO.web apps to be available via "Open With" option, administrators need to use the "omero.web.open_with" configuration option. This has now been added to the server upgrade documentation.

Developer updates include:

-  exposed more enumerations from ome-model
-  added ROIs support to the Web API

This release also upgrades the version of Bio-Formats which OMERO uses to
5.5.0, adding support for two new file formats as well as a number of file
format support bug fixes (see the
[Bio-Formats version history](https://docs.openmicroscopy.org/bio-formats/5.5.0/about/whats-new.html) for full details).

Upgrade information is on the [server upgrade page](https://docs.openmicroscopy.org/omero/5.3.2/sysadmins/server-upgrade.html). Any problems or comments, please use the [OME Forums or mailing lists]({{ site.baseurl }}/support/)

The software is available at [archived downloads](http://downloads.openmicroscopy.org/omero/5.3.2).
