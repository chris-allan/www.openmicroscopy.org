title: Release of OMERO.server 5.6.1 and OMERO.web 5.6.3
intro-blurb: This release includes OMERO.server 5.6.1, OMERO.web 5.6.3 and OMERO.py 5.6.2
---

As [previously announced](https://forum.image.sc/t/34691), today we are
releasing OMERO.server 5.6.1 which fixes several security vulnerabilities, one
of them critical, so we urge everyone to **upgrade as soon as
possible**. There are **no known workarounds** to the most severe
vulnerability. We are also releasing OMERO.web 5.6.3 which fixes one security
vulnerability and OMERO.py 5.6.2.

OMERO.server 5.6.1 runs in the same deployment environments as OMERO.server 5.6.0 and
the Bio-Formats Memoizer cache will not be invalidated so the upgrade
should be minor. The only client that you must upgrade is OMERO.web
though we also recommend upgrading OMERO.py.

### Security Fixes:

OMERO security fixes are available for only OMERO.server 5.6 and greater. The
vulnerabilities fixed by this release are:

* [2019-SV1 Reader Used Files]({{ site.baseurl }}/security/advisories/2019-SV1-reader-used-files/) (medium)
* [2019-SV2 Group Permissions]({{ site.baseurl }}/security/advisories/2019-SV2-group-permissions/) (medium)
* [2019-SV3 User Privacy]({{ site.baseurl }}/security/advisories/2019-SV3-user-privacy/) (medium)
* [2019-SV4 Web Referrer Leakage]({{ site.baseurl }}/security/advisories/2019-SV4-web-referrer-leakage/) (major)
* [2019-SV5 Bypass Filters]({{ site.baseurl }}/security/advisories/2019-SV5-bypass-filters/) (critical)
* [2019-SV6 Group Owner Context]({{ site.baseurl }}/security/advisories/2019-SV6-group-owner-context/) (low)

### Mitigation:

If you cannot perform the upgrade at this time then we strongly
recommend that you **shut down your OMERO server** until upgrade is
possible. At the very least you should switch your server into
[read-only mode](https://docs.openmicroscopy.org/omero/5.6/developers/Server/Clustering.html#read-only)
and block OMERO.blitz API access to all but omero-web. If you hold any
private data on OMERO.server then you should firewall it so that login
is available *only* to those who may read *all* the data. We have
**not** determined that running OMERO 5.6.0 or earlier even with these
restrictions is at all safe.

### Installing the Software:

For full details of the changes with the OMERO 5.6 series see the
[OMERO 5.6.0]({{ site.baseurl }}/2020/01/15/omero-5-6-0.html) release
announcement. OMERO.server 5.6.1 is designed to be a small step beyond the 5.6.0 release
in order to simplify upgrade. Full documentation for this release is available
under <https://docs.openmicroscopy.org/omero/5.6.1/>.

OMERO.server 5.6.1 is available from
[archived downloads](https://github.com/ome/openmicroscopy/releases/tag/v5.6.1)
and [omero-web 5.6.3](https://pypi.org/project/omero-web/5.6.3/) also
includes security fixes. These have been tested with
[omero-py 5.6.2](https://pypi.org/project/omero-py/5.6.2/) so we
recommend that you upgrade OMERO.py on both server and web deployments.

Official Docker images are available as usual on Docker Hub with either
the latest or the 5.6 tag:

* <https://hub.docker.com/r/openmicroscopy/omero-web-standalone>
* <https://hub.docker.com/r/openmicroscopy/omero-server>

You're invited to discuss this announcement on
[the image.sc forum](https://forum.image.sc/tags/c/data-management/29/omero).

All the best with your upgrades,

The OME Team
