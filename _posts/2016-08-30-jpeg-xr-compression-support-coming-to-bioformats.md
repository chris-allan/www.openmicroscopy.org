title: JPEG XR compression support coming to Bio-Formats
intro-blurb: The OME team is delighted to announce that thanks to a collaboration between Glencoe Software and Carl Zeiss Microscopy GmbH, support for whole slide images compressed with the JPEG XR compression scheme is coming to Bio-Formats
---
Glencoe Software and ZEISS will collaborate to extend the Bio-Formats library to support whole slide images
 with the JPEG XR compression scheme, like those recorded by the ZEISS Axio Scan.Z1 virtual slide scanner. 

Jason Swedlow says, "We are particularly excited that the software we build in this collaboration will
be available for anyone to download and use. This is a great example of how industrial partners can work
together and build important capabilities that benefit the global scientific and pathology imaging
communities. The work we do together will benefit users of ZEISS Axio Scan.Z1 and indeed anyone who uses JPEG
XR compression in their image data.‚Äù  

This development will allow researchers, pathologists and imaging specialists working with these images
worldwide to use a whole range of open source tools that rely on Bio-Formats for image file translation.
