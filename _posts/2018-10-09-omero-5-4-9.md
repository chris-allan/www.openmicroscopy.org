title: Release of OMERO 5.4.9
intro-blurb: The OME team is pleased to announce the release of OMERO 5.4.9.
---

This release addresses a critical import issue where files can be silently
skipped.

Import improvements include:

- ``ImportCandidates`` returns filesets even when files are shared between
  several filesets independently of the scanning order
- insight: bug fixes for the lightweight importer UI

Other improvements include:

- BlitzGateway: new API to read ``OriginalFile`` as file-like objects
- server: add code to dispose of `Graphics` objects in the server
- Javadoc: add links to developer documentation for graph operations


Upgrade information is on the [server upgrade page](https://docs.openmicroscopy.org/omero/5.4.9/sysadmins/server-upgrade.html).

The software is also available at [archived downloads](https://downloads.openmicroscopy.org/omero/5.4.9).
