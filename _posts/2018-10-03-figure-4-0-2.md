We are pleased to announce the release of OMERO.figure 4.0.2.

- Add new functionalities to the script used to export PDF/TIFF so that other tools can use the script. The changes are not yet used by OMERO.figure. Thanks to Andreas Knab ([PR #306](https://github.com/ome/omero-figure/pull/306))

The app is available to install from
[PyPI](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/omero-figure/).

Any problems or comments, please use the [OME Forums or mailing lists]({{ site.baseurl }}/support/).
