title: Release of OMERO 5.3.4
intro-blurb: The OME team announces OMERO 5.3.4, a security update which we recommend all sysadmins upgrade to as soon as possible.
---
Today we are releasing OMERO 5.3.4. This is a security release:

[2017-SV5-filename-2]({{ site.baseurl }}/security/advisories/2017-SV5-filename-2) prevents users from accessing and
manipulating other people's data by creating an original file and changing its
path using "/" characters to point to another user's file on the underlying
filesystem.

This release also upgrades the version of Bio-Formats which OMERO uses to
[5.5.3](https://docs.openmicroscopy.org/bio-formats/5.5.3/about/whats-new.html).

Upgrade information is at [server upgrade](https://docs.openmicroscopy.org/omero/5.3.4/sysadmins/server-upgrade.html).

It is highly recommended that you upgrade your server.

The software is available at [archived downloads](https://downloads.openmicroscopy.org/omero/5.3.4).

Any problems or comments, please use the [OME Forums or mailing lists]({{ site.baseurl }}/support/).
