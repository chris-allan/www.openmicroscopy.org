---
Today we are releasing OMERO 5.3.4. This is a security release - see the
[security advisory]({{ site.baseurl }}/security/advisories/2017-SV5-filename-2) for further details.

This release also upgrades the version of Bio-Formats which OMERO uses to
[5.5.3](https://docs.openmicroscopy.org/bio-formats/5.5.3/about/whats-new.html).

Note you must run an database upgrade script as part of the 5.3.4 server
upgrade process. Full information is at
[server upgrade](https://docs.openmicroscopy.org/omero/5.3.4/sysadmins/server-upgrade.html).

It is highly recommended that you upgrade your server.

The software is available at [archived downloads](https://downloads.openmicroscopy.org/omero/5.3.4).

Any problems or comments, please use the [OME Forums or mailing lists]({{ site.baseurl }}/support/).
