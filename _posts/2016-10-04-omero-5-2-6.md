intro-blurb: The OME team is pleased to announce the release of OMERO 5.2.6
---
Today we are releasing OMERO 5.2.6. This is a bug-fix release focusing on services closure and a DB upgrade fix.

Improvements include:

-  fixed closure of session in Java when using Ice 3.5
-  fixed memory leak where services were not correctly closed
-  added a DB upgrade patch to fix errors only affecting DBs that have been upgraded from OMERO 4.4[1]
-  fixed a MATLAB regression introduced in 5.2.2, casting error.
-  fixed error in logs on getProjectedThumbnail
 
Support for OMERO.web deployment using Apache has also been deprecated and is
likely to be removed during the 5.3.x line.

Upgrade information is available on the 
server upgrade page](http://www.openmicroscopy.org/site/support/omero5.2/sysadmins/server-upgrade.html)

The software is available at:
