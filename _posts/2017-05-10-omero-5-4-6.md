title: Release of OMERO 5.4.6
intro-blurb: The OME team is pleased to announce the release of OMERO 5.4.6.
---
Today we are releasing OMERO 5.4.6.
This introduces a significant new subsystem for read-only operation
with which servers can be configured not to make changes to the database,
the filesystem, or both. The goal is to permit the horizontal scaling
of OMERO installations. Information on how to configure a read-only server
is available at [Read-Only](https://docs.openmicroscopy.org/omero/5.4.6/developers/Server/Clustering.html#read-only)

Further improvements include:

* enabled big image support in ImageJ/Fiji
* reduced the number of threads used by OMERO.web
* fixed other bugs in OMERO.web including:
   * broken History tab
   * handling of script params
   * pagination calculations
   * public user login
   * browsing to user's data in IE
* fixed the chosen login ports for OMERO.cli

Developer updates include:

* a new command to set custom physical pixel size using OMERO.cli
* deprecated Repository::pixels and TinyImportFixture
* improved test infrastructure
* reduced background events in the center panel plugin when not displaying Thumbnails
* added extra controls when specifying map and gamma in the rendering engine

This release also upgrades the version of Bio-Formats which OMERO
uses to 5.8.2. **Note:** this is a significant upgrade and will
invalidate the Bio-Formats Memoizer cache. Please see the upgrade
guide for further information.


The software is also available at [archived downloads](https://downloads.openmicroscopy.org/omero/5.4.6).
