title: Release of OMERO.server 5.6.3
---

Today we are releasing OMERO.server 5.6.3 which
uses OMERO.blitz 5.5.8 to expand the
OMERO API's `Duplicate` functionality to allow the duplication of
images, attachments, and other model objects that are backed by files on
disk. This long-awaited ability to create a true copy of microscopy data can be
invoked via the OMERO.cli duplicate plugin, also available from PyPI; if
you already use [`omero-cli-duplicate`](https://pypi.org/project/omero-cli-duplicate/) then we suggest upgrading to at
least 0.4.0. We hope that this significantly benefits users who are
collaborating with other groups and publishing data to the wider
community.

OMERO.server 5.6.3 runs in the same deployment environments as
OMERO.server 5.6.0.
It has been tested with
OMERO.py 5.8.0 and OMERO.web 5.8.0 which are available from PyPI.
The Bio-Formats Memoizer cache will not be
invalidated on upgrade from OMERO.server 5.6.2.

### Installing the Software:

For full details of the changes with the OMERO 5.6 series see the
[OMERO 5.6.0]({{ site.baseurl }}/2020/01/15/omero-5-6-0.html) release
announcement. Full documentation for this release is available
under <https://docs.openmicroscopy.org/omero/5.6.3/>.

This release has been tested with
[OMERO.py 5.8.0](https://pypi.org/project/omero-py/5.8.0/) and
[OMERO.web 5.8.0](https://pypi.org/project/omero-web/5.8.0/) so we
recommend that you upgrade OMERO.py and OMERO.web to at least 5.8.0 on
both server and web deployments.

Official Docker images are available as usual on Docker Hub with either
the latest or the 5.6 tag:

* <https://hub.docker.com/r/openmicroscopy/omero-web-standalone>
* <https://hub.docker.com/r/openmicroscopy/omero-server>

You are invited to discuss this announcement on
[the image.sc forum](https://forum.image.sc/tags/c/data-management/omero).

All the best with your upgrades,

The OME Team
