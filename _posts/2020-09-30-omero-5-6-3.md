title: Release of OMERO.server 5.6.3
---

Today we are releasing OMERO.server 5.6.3 which uses OMERO.blitz 5.5.8
to expand the OMERO API's `Duplicate` functionality to allow the
duplication of images, attachments, and other model objects that are
backed by files on disk. Where possible, duplicated files are linked with originals
to save space on underlying storage. This long-awaited ability to create
a true copy of microscopy data can be invoked via the OMERO.cli
duplicate plugin, available from PyPI; if you already use
[`omero-cli-duplicate`](https://pypi.org/project/omero-cli-duplicate/)
then we suggest upgrading to at least 0.4.0.

When <a href="https://omero-guides.readthedocs.io/en/latest/introduction/docs/data-management.html#manage-images-in-datasets-projects">managing images</a> in the tree view, users could already link images into multiple datasets in the same group.
This new feature goes further in allowing users to create a duplicate of
an image that is truly independent of the original.
We hope that it
significantly benefits users who are collaborating with other groups and
publishing data to the wider community.

OMERO.server 5.6.3 runs in the same deployment environments as
OMERO.server 5.6.0. It has been tested with OMERO.py 5.8.0 and OMERO.web
5.8.0 which are available from PyPI. The Bio-Formats Memoizer cache will
not be invalidated on upgrade from OMERO.server 5.6.2.

### Installing the Software:

For full details of the changes with the OMERO 5.6 series see the
[OMERO 5.6.0]({{ site.baseurl }}/2020/01/15/omero-5-6-0.html) release
announcement. Full documentation for this release is available
under <https://docs.openmicroscopy.org/omero/5.6.3/>.

This release has been tested with
[OMERO.py 5.8.0](https://pypi.org/project/omero-py/5.8.0/) and
[OMERO.web 5.8.0](https://pypi.org/project/omero-web/5.8.0/) so we
recommend that you upgrade OMERO.py and OMERO.web to at least 5.8.0 on
both server and web deployments.

Official Docker images are available as usual on Docker Hub with either
the latest or the 5.6 tag:

* <https://hub.docker.com/r/openmicroscopy/omero-web-standalone>
* <https://hub.docker.com/r/openmicroscopy/omero-server>

You are invited to discuss this announcement on
[the image.sc forum](https://forum.image.sc/tags/c/data-management/omero).

All the best with your upgrades,

The OME Team
