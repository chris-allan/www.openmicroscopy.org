Today we are releasing OMERO 5.3.0, a full production-ready release of OMERO 5.3.0; featuring a major reworking of OMERO.web and web apps; dropping support for Windows for the server and for deploying OMERO.web using Apache; and introducing new user features and many fixes and performance improvements:

-  improved support for many file formats via Bio-Formats 5.4.0
-  introduced ROI Folders
-  new UI for displaying Screen Plate Well data in OMERO.web and OMERO.insight
-  support for lookup tables and reverse intensity rendering
-  color mapping for multiple channels without set colors has been improved to
-  use RGBRGB rather than RGBBB (i.e. to loop through red, green, blue rather
-  than setting all later channels to blue)
-  support for histograms in the clients and server
-  ability to filter by ratings in OMERO.web
-  added 'Open With...' functionality to OMERO.web
-  color of shapes is now handled according to the data model, using RGBA rather than ARGB format (an sql script is available to upgrade existing shapes; this will not happen automatically as part of the OMERO upgrade)
-  improved performance for moving and deleting data
-  Wells can now be annotated and searched by annotations
-  enabled downloading/exporting of plate data
-  improved reading of tables data
-  script improvements including ability to create tiled images from big ROIs, fixes for creating standard images from ROIs, and to stop the Combine_Images script from ignoring pixel sizes set on the target images
-  names for plates and images set in the metadata read by Bio-Formats are now imported into OMERO and the filename (which was previously used) is only used where an alternative has not been set
-  many bug fixes

Sysadmin changes include:

-  added support for Ice 3.6.3
