Today we are releasing OME Files C++ 0.2.3.

-  OME-TIFF reader
-  OME-TIFF writer

This release contains minor bugfixes only.

Changes in this release include:

-  OME-TIFF bugfix for Plane element handling

You can find further information on which features will be included in upcoming releases via the [Trello board for version 0.3.0](https://trello.com/b/wA1T35Ld/ome-files-c-0-3-0)
(note that this is a work in progress and subject to change).

**Errata**

Support for building on Windows with msbuild is currently non-functional; please use Ninja for the time being.

On Windows, "ome-files info" will display an error if run from a directory containing a space in it. As a workaround, use "libexec\ome\files\info.exe" directly.

**Support**

For any problems or comments, please use the [OME Forums or mailing lists]({{ site.baseurl }}/support/).
