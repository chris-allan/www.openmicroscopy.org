title: Release of OMERO 5.4.10
intro-blurb: The OME team announces OMERO 5.4.10, a critical update for Java clients
---

This release addresses a critical login issue for Java clients such as Insight
and ``bin/omero import``. New releases of Java include a change to the
``java.security`` file that disables anonymous cipher suites. This
change causes ``SSLHandshakeException`` when the client attempts to
authenticate to OMERO.blitz.

The OMERO 5.4.10 release has clients check the security property
``jdk.tls.disabledAlgorithms`` for the value "anon" and remove it if present
thus allowing authentication to proceed.

Upgrade information is on the [server upgrade page](https://docs.openmicroscopy.org/omero/5.4.10/sysadmins/server-upgrade.html).

The software is also available at [archived downloads](https://downloads.openmicroscopy.org/omero/5.4.10).

Any problems or comments, please use the [OME Forums or mailing lists]({{ site.baseurl }}/support/).
