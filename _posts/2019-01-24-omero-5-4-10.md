title: Release of OMERO 5.4.10
intro-blurb: The OME team announces OMERO 5.4.10, a critical update for Java clients
---

This release addresses a critical login issue for Java clients such as
OMERO.insight. New releases of Java include a change to the
``java.security`` file that disables anonymous cipher suites. This
change causes ``SSLHandshakeException`` when the client attempts to
authenticate to OMERO.blitz.

The OMERO 5.4.10 release has some clients like OMERO.insight check the security
property ``jdk.tls.disabledAlgorithms`` for the value "anon" and remove it if
present thus allowing authentication to proceed.

This release is for clients only and OMERO 5.4.10 servers do not need
to be upgraded.

The software is also available at [archived downloads](https://downloads.openmicroscopy.org/omero/5.4.10).
