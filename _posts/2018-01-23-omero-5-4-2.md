Today we are releasing OMERO 5.4.2, a bug-fix release.

Improvements include:

  OMERO.server
* added references to the new OMERO pyramid format documentation (within the
  OME Data Model and File Formats documentation)
* faster loading of thumbnails for large Plates after a recent regression
* made projecting images belonging to another user only possible for users
  with the required permissions to save the new images
* updated SwingX library version used by OMERO.insight to stop insight-ij
  plugin crashing in Fiji
* CLI updates:
  * ``import --target`` into a container without the necessary permissions 
    now fails before file upload starts and more transparently
  * ``admin mail`` timeout is now configurable via ``--wait``
  * added ``admin log`` command for inserting statements to the server log

Sysadmin changes include:

* added warning about the need to regenerate your NGINX config for every
  upgrade

Developer updates include:

* added methods for updating OMERO.tables
* Java Gateway fixes for sessions and rendering
* fixed retrieval of Plate thumbnail URLs
* improved 'Editing OMERO.web' documentation
* improved Slice documentation for API deprecations
* substantial effort to make third-party repositories easily testable;
