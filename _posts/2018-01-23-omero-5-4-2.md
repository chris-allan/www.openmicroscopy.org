Today we are releasing OMERO 5.4.2, a bug-fix release.

Improvements include:

* added documentation on a complete workflow for publishing data from
  OMERO.server
* added references to the new OMERO pyramid format documentation (within the
  OME Data Model and File Formats documentation)
* faster loading of thumbnails for large Plates after a recent regression
* made projecting images belonging to another user only possible for users
  with the required permissions to save the new images
* updated SwingX library version used by OMERO.insight to stop insight-ij
  plugin crashing in Fiji
* CLI updates:
  * ``import --target`` into a container without the necessary permissions 
    now fails before file upload starts and more transparently
  * ``admin mail`` timeout is now configurable via ``--wait``
  * added ``admin log`` command for inserting statements to the server log

Sysadmin changes include:

* added warning about the need to regenerate your NGINX config for every
  upgrade
* fixed documentation bug affecting OMERO-version-specific guidance
* fixed OMERO.tables startup race condition
* server performance improvements

Developer updates include:

* various testing improvements including refactoring and build system
  changes, designed to permit integration tests in downstream projects and
  testing of external CLI plugins (see [this PR on GitHub](https://github.com/openmicroscopy/openmicroscopy/pull/5616)
  for further details)
* added methods for updating OMERO.tables
* Java Gateway fixes for sessions and rendering
* extended Python and Java examples to include Map Annotations and histograms
* improved 'Editing OMERO.web' documentation
* improved Slice documentation for API deprecations

This release also upgrades the version of Bio-Formats that OMERO uses to
5.7.3.
