We are pleased to announce the release of OMERO.figure 3.1.1.
This is a bug fixing release

Bug fixes include:

* Fix export of figures created before the introduction of the Reverse Intensity feature in OMERO 5.3.0
* Fix label of channels with LUT assigned. This fixes the failure when exporting the figure
* Set the background color of all pages when exporting a figure on multiple pages

Any problems or comments, please use the [OME Forums or mailing lists]({{ site.baseurl }}/support/).
