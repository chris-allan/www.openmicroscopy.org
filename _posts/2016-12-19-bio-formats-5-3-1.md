Today we are releasing Bio-Formats 5.3.1, a bug fix release for the (OME-)TIFF format:

*  fixed invalid IFD values when writing TIFF or OME-TIFF files with Bio-Formats 5.3.0

This bug affected the writing of TIFF and OME-TIFF via client code using 'loci.formats.TiffWriter', converting to a TIFF or OME-TIFF using 'bfconvert' command line tool or exporting to TIFF or OME-TIFF using FIJI Bio-Formats exporter. If your workflow is affected, you should upgrade as soon as possible.

Full details can be found in the [Bio-Formats version history](https://docs.openmicroscopy.org/bio-formats/5.3.1/about/whats-new.html).

The software is available at [https://downloads.openmicroscopy.org/bio-formats/5.3.1/](http://downloads.openmicroscopy.org/bio-formats/5.3.1) and will shortly be available from the Java-8 update site for Fiji users.

Thanks to the community for notifying the OME team of this issue. We revised our testing procedures and apologize for any difficulty caused by this bug.

Any problems or comments, please use the [OME Forums or mailing lists]({{ site.baseurl }}/support/).
