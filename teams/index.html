      jobTitle: Software Developer
      description: Dominik Lindner joined the team in Dundee as a Software Developer in February 2014. After studying Bioinformatics at the University of Applied Sciences Weihenstephan, Freising, he worked at different places as Java Software Developer with a bit of Linux system administration. His projects mostly had a bioinformatics background (analysis of multiple sequence alignments, DNA sequence optimization) with a short side trip into the world of logistics/warehousing. In his spare time he enjoys exploring Scotland's countryside on foot, on the bicycle or on the motorbike; respectively when the days are short and the weather's bad, trying to set up the ultimate Linux system.

      familyName: Moore
      jobTitle: Software Developer
      description: Will Moore came to Dundee as a cell biologist to do his PhD and then joined Jason's lab as a post-doc in 2003. Having got interested in the OME project from a user's point of view, he decided on a change of scene and left the lab to do an MSc in Applied Computing at Dundee University's School of Computing. He returned to the Swedlow lab for his MSc project. His goal was to make it easier for biologists to record their experimental metadata in a digital form. This was the start of the OMERO.editor development, which continued when he joined the lab as a developer in October 2007. His other interests include mountaineering, sailing and motorbiking.

He studied at Charles University of Prague where he received Master of Science degree in Physics and the University of Freiburg in Germany where he received PhD in Biology. Throughout his PhD studies and his further career as a researcher he was intensively using conventional, confocal and multiphoton fluorescence microscopy applications on biological systems. He was adapting these optical microscopy techniques for particular biological problems, and also worked on the subsequent image analysis of microscopic images in a range of image analysis programs. He enjoys yoga, reading and chess.
