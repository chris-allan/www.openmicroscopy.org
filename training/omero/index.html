                Preparation for an OMERO workshop includes server setup, configuration and import of
                sample data. Guides are available to indicate where to download the data, what import steps to
                perform and any scripts that are needed to prepare the data.
                Some longer workflows also benefit from being partially completed
                before the workshop.
            </p>

                If you are interested in running your own workshop, please contact us so we can
                advise on what to include and how best to prepare for your attendees.

                The training resources are hosted on several github repositories:

                        is tagged for each workshop we run.
                        This allows us to know the precise version of all software, scripts
                        and guides used for each training session.
