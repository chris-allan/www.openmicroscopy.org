        <h2>Fast figures from your OMERO images</h2>

        <h2>Smart figures with metadata</h2>
        <p>
            OMERO.figure combines OMERO's powerful image rendering and
            metadata to provide a tool for rapid figure creation. Each panel
            of the figure becomes a multi-dimensional image viewer, allowing
            you to zoom and pan, adjust rendering settings and even scroll
            through Z and Time. Figures can be exported as TIFF images or PDF
            documents, so you can move seamlessly to other editing tools such
            as Adobe Illustrator.

        <h2>Shortcuts for common tasks</h2>

        <p>
            Many tasks of figure creation are very time consuming when done
            manually. OMERO.figure provides tools to get the job done quickly.
            All of these features work with multiple selected panels at once,
            making it easy to keep similar panels in sync.
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Align to grid</strong>: snap panels to
                perfectly-spaced rows and columns.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Adjust rendering settings</strong>: toggle channels,
                change colours and adjust levels.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Clever labels</strong>: labels are bound to the chosen
                spot on each panel and can
                be auto-generated from image metadata.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Copy and paste</strong>: duplicate rows or columns
                instantly, aligned perfectly.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Scroll Z and Time</strong>: move image panels through
                Z and Time dimensions.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Zoom, Pan and Rotate</strong>: crop your images simply
                by zooming, panning and rotating the viewport without ever
                losing the full image.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Crop to ROI</strong>: use Regions of Interest from the
                OMERO server to crop images.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Accurate scalebars</strong>: use the pixel size
                metadata from OMERO to add 'live' scalebars that update as you
                zoom.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Full undo and redo</strong>: for extra convenience.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Set 'dpi'</strong>: you can control the resolution of
                images embedded in exported PDF pages.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Multi-page figures</strong>: create, edit and view
                several figure pages within one OMERO.figure file at
                once.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Export TIFF or PNG</strong>: export as multi-page PNGs
                or TIFF images (at 300 dpi) suitable for journal submission or
                further editing.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Export with panel images</strong>: optionally export
                all panels as separate TIFFs to validate figure building steps
                or for use elsewhere.
            </li>
          </ul>

        <h2>Power of the web</h2>
        <p>
            You can create beautiful figures in your browser, then share them
            with others. Depending on your OMERO permissions settings, you can
            even make them public, so everyone can explore your figures
            interactively.
