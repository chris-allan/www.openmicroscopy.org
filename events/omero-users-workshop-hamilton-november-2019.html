                <p class="event-day-description">The Open Microscopy Environment (OME) is an open-source software project that develops tools that enable access, analysis, visualization, sharing and publication of biological image data. We support more than 150 image data formats across many imaging modalities including medical imaging, high-content screening and whole-slide imaging.
                We support and visualize multi-channel 3D timelapse images.
 
                OMERO, a component of OME, is a software platform for image data management and analysis which will be presented in this course. 
                Import, organisation, viewing, searching, annotation and publishing of imaging data with OMERO will be shown.
                </p>
                <p class="event-day-description">
                This workshop will cover all of the main functions of OMERO. We will demonstrate data import, organisation, viewing, searching, annotation and publishing. After we cover the basics of OMERO, we will demonstrate manual data processing and automated processing workflows using a range of open source applications running alongside OMERO. We will demonstrate how to integrate a variety of processing tools with OMERO such as ImageJ/Fiji, R and CellProfiler and how to programmatically generate output ready for publication.
                </p>
                <p class="event-day-description">
                This workshop is designed for researchers at all levels who work with data from digital microscopes or other imaging systems. The workshop includes presentations and hands-on session. Prior knowledge in microscopy, scripting and data analysis is not required.
                </p>
                <p class="event-day-description">
                Any student/researcher dealing with scientific images is more than welcome to join this workshop.
