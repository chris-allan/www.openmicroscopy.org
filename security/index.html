                    <p>OME takes its responsibility to help keep our usersâ€™ data secure very seriously. We strongly encourage people to report any security issues to our private security mailing list.</p>
                    <p>Emails sent to us are read and acknowledged with a non-automated response. For issues that are complicated and require significant attention, we will open an investigation and keep you informed of our progress.</p>
                    <p>Details will only be released to the public once we have a fix in place.</p>
                    <p>Please note that the security mailing list should only be used for reporting undisclosed security vulnerabilities in OME products and managing the process of fixing such vulnerabilities. We cannot accept bug reports or other queries at this address. All mail sent to this address that does not relate to a security problem will be ignored.</p>                
                    <p>For bug reports and other issues, please use our public mailing lists and forums.</p>
